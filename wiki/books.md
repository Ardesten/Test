r/baduk's book recommendations ordered by experience level

###Beginner (30k to 20k)

Beginners will most likely only need one of these books to learn the rules (in addition to a good tsumego collection!) as there is a lot of overlap among books that teach the rules.

**Learn to Play Go** Series by Janice Kim

**Go: A Complete Introduction to the Game** by Cho Chikun

**Level Up!** by Yoo Chang-Hyuk

**Graded Go Problems for Beginners Vol. 1** by Kano Yoshinori


###DDK (20k to 10k)

In the range between Beginner and SDK, books may not be necessary because of the quick improvement that can be had from playing and tsumego alone.  However, these are some good resources aimed at the mid-kyu player:

**Opening Theory Made Easy** by Otake Hideo

**Second Book of Go** by Richard Bozulich

**Fundamental Principles of Go** by Yilun Yang

**Graded Go Problems for Beginners Vol. 2** by Kano Yoshinori


###SDK (10k to 1k)

At the SDK level, books start to be more specialized.

**1001 Life and Death Problems**

**Get Strong at Tesuji**  by Richard Bozulich

**Elementary Go Series**

**Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go** by Toshiro Kageyama

**Jump Level Up!**
