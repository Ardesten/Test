## Interactive tutorials

#### ⬤ [**OGS tutorial**](https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go)
A minimalistic, mobile friendly tutorial, with nothing more but brief descirptions of the rules, One of the fastest ways to learn enough to be able to play, but you will have to figure out a lot on your own.

#### ⬤ [**Learn to Play Go**](https://www.learn-go.net/)
A mobile friendly website dedicated to full explanations of the rules and basic strategies. All puzzles explain both good and bad moves, but it can be a rather lengthy read sometimes.

A sort of a compromise between full and minimalistic explanations, mobile friendly.

#### ⬤ [**The Interactive Way to Go**](http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/)
A highly regarded tutorial with content localized to many languages. Unfortunatelly technically very outdated (flash based), will not work on mobile and might be difficult to run on any modern browser.
